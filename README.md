# Step Functions SQS collector

First engine component: long-polls `sfn-status-events`, maps each EventBridge
"Step Functions Execution Status Change" message to a `RunStatus`, stores it, and
deletes the message only after the database write commits.

## Run on the laptop

```bash
aws sso login --profile hca-dev          # your SSO profile name
export AWS_PROFILE=hca-dev
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Start an execution of the test state machine. You should see lines like:

```
INSERTED test-machine exec-1 -> RUNNING
UPDATED  test-machine exec-1 -> FAILED (Glue.AWSGlueException)
```

Run history is kept in `./data/monitor.mv.db` (H2). Browse it with any JDBC
client using `jdbc:h2:file:./data/monitor;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE`, user `sa`, no password:

```sql
SELECT job_name, run_name, status, started_at, stopped_at, error_code
FROM run_status ORDER BY observed_at DESC;
```

## Behaviour

| Situation | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Valid Step Functions event | Stored, then deleted from the queue |
| Duplicate or late event (e.g. RUNNING after SUCCEEDED) | Ignored as stale, deleted |
| Redrive (higher `redriveCount`) | Replaces the earlier attempt's status |
| Other valid JSON event | Deleted, ignored |
| Unparseable message | Left on the queue; moves to `sfn-status-dlq` after 5 receives |
| Database write fails | Not deleted; retried when it becomes visible again |
| SSO session expired / credentials missing | Logs `COLLECTOR_CREDENTIALS_FAILED` once, retries every 60 s, logs `COLLECTOR_RECOVERED` after `aws sso login` |

## Moving to EC2 later

No code change. Don't set `AWS_PROFILE`; the default credential chain picks up the
`hca-pipeline-monitor-engine` instance role. Swap the H2 URL for PostgreSQL when ready
(the schema is plain SQL).

## Troubleshooting on a corporate laptop

- `Unable to load credentials from any of the providers` with an SSO profile:
  check the `sso` and `ssooidc` SDK modules are on the classpath (they are in this pom).
- `PKIX path building failed`: import the company root CA into the JDK truststore
  (`keytool -importcert -cacerts -alias corp-root -file corp-root.cer`), and set
  `HTTPS_PROXY` / `-Dhttps.proxyHost` if a proxy is required.
